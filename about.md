## Hey There!
As an engineer, my mission is to create beautiful and meaningful things. I enjoy all opportunities to share this spirit of digital creation, so let's connect and explore the next project to change lives. I enjoy pair programming, challenging myself with new technologies, methodologies, and am always open to discussing the current challenges and goals of your business.

## The Story So Far
I've been in the technology field since 2013, and in that time have performed a variety of roles. The most recent of which includes my time as a Software Engineer, but I've also spent a considerable amount of time in a space that exists at the intersection of technology and education. I'm very passionate about helping others learn and pursue their passions, and have done so at one of the most successful and oldest web-development immersives in the world.

## Let's Talk
Presently, I'm pursuing new opportunities as a Software Engineer. I've spent extensive time utilizing full-stack JavaScript tools and frameworks for recent projects. I have prior experience with Ruby and frameworks including Sinatra and Rails, and am very interested in diving into other technologies, especially Clojure and Elm. If any of this sounds good to you, let's talk!
