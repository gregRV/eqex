Just a guy who's excited to dive deeper into the world of web-development and software engineering! On this blog, I'll be sharing my progress via updates on personal projects, tutorials, various reading, and other fun life experiences.

My old blog, [Hyperbolic Time Chamber][hbtc], has lots of great bits to check out from my time as a student at [Dev Bootcamp][dbc], San Francisco.
