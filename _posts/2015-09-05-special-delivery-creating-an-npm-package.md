## Special Delivery! Creating an npm Package

### npm? 'package'?

* what is npm
* why create package
* who benefits

As developers, we rely heavily on libraries written by other members of the community on a daily basis. That's actually one of the best things (in my opinion) about being in this space- people are constantly pushing themselves to share knowledge, tools, and practices to help make others' workflows and daily lives that much easier. Some of these libraries come from huge companies like Google and Facebook, while other (just as popular) tools are contributed by small teams (or even individuals) who do this purely out of hobby. One of the best parts about this system is that creating and sharing your own package is made incredibly easy by npm, the node.js package management system. Who knows, maybe you'll author the next _(insert 20XX hawt.js framework)_!

### Let's get started

* npm init
* fill in package.json
* add something to index.js (that is exported)
* sign up w/npm
* publish module to npm
* now people can require your package

_This tutorial will assume you have basic skills with command-line and JavaScript_
