[SpeckJS](http://speckjs.github.io/) is an npm module that parses JavaScript and outputs unit tests. SpeckJS currently supports the Tape, Jasmine, and Mocha/Chai testing frameworks. Aside from it's standalone core module, SpeckJS also comes with plugins for [Grunt](https://github.com/speckjs/grunt-speckjs), [Gulp](https://github.com/speckjs/gulp-speckjs) and [Atom](https://github.com/speckjs/atom-speckjs).

Our goal with SpeckJS is to make it as easy as possible to get started using Test Driven Development on a new project, to quickly add unit tests to your existing project, or anywhere in between. We know the value of well-tested code, and SpeckJS is here to make that simpler than ever.

To see just how easy it is to use, here's a GIF of the Atom plugin in action:

I'll be adding more posts soon offering an inside look at the development of SpeckJS, including technical hurdles our team encountered, interesting JavaScript discoveries we made, our Git and issue workflow, and more! But for now, you can visit [http://speckjs.github.io](http://speckjs.github.io/) to learn more! Happy testing!
