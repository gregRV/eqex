This past Summer I had the opportunity to meet and join the team behind [Offcourse](https://offcourse-nightly.herokuapp.com/)- an open source educational platform based out of Amsterdam. Though still early in development, when released, Offcourse will provide an environment for individuals to craft their own curriculum on any subject and share it freely with the world. Whether it's learning a new programming language, or learning how to bake a cake, community members ranging from beginners to industry experts will have a centralized space in Offcourse for creating and exploring these customized learning paths.

Offcourse is comprised of a small core team, who's currently collaborating internationally. These passionate life-long learners are working diligently around the clock (and the globe) to help make learning, sharing, and teaching as accessible as possible. Like the early stages of many startups, Offcourse is currently researching various fronts and applying new insights learned along the way. As the year's end draws near, a few of the team's goals include:

- completing a beautiful, fast, and mobile-friendly UI
- refactoring parts of the codebase to utilize new tech (namely Clojurescript)
- regular blog posts about covering Offcourse's progress

You can find an early glimpse of the prototype UI [here](https://offcourse-nightly.herokuapp.com/featured). In future releases, you'll be able to peruse the different courses and click on the tags for things you may want to learn later. If you have any thoughts, opinions, or questions about the platform, the team would love to hear it! Feedback has been vital in steering the direction of Offcourse, and it's mission to help shape the future of education. We've been fortunate to consistently receive feedback from college students, software engineers, academics, and we'd love to hear what you have to say, as well!

Happy learning,

Offcourse
