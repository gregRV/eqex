Yesterday I attended [Day of the Devs](http://www.dayofthedevs.com/)- an awesome annual event (with this being the third) where indie video game developers are able to showcase projects that they’ve been working on, including some that are just about ready for release. This is particularly exciting because, despite being indie titles with considerably lower budgets than larger studios, some of them have gained a ton of traction in the industry, so being able to play them before their official release was a great time.

Something that I really appreciate about a lot of indie titles is that more often than not, the team wants to create something unique and personal, as opposed to churning out a new iteration of some franchise annually like a lot of companies currently bank on. The games at DotD’s were bursting with character, beautiful art, and definitely made an impression. It’s really cool of companies like Humble Bundle, Unreal, Twitch, and Facebook to sponsor these kinds of events and provide a venue for smaller companies to bring their projects to the community.

I got some footage of the event which you can check out below. I had a blast and would encourage anyone who’s remotely interested in video games, programming, technology, or just the creative space in general to check it out next year! The best part of these kinds of events is chatting with the creators who are usually super excited to talk more about their work and answer any questions. There’s a ton of passion, creativity, and energy put into all of these, which is super inspiring and makes me want to get back to coding my own fun projects :)
