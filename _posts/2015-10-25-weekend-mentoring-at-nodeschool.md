Immersing myself in the tech community (and community in general) is hands-down one of my favorite things about living in San Francisco. When I first thought I _might_ be interested in learning to program a few years ago, I remember how desperate I was to find someone - anyone - who I could go to with my questions. Beyond that, it would have been amazing to find someone who made their way into the industry through “non-traditional” means (self-taught, attended an “immersive” aka “coding bootcamp”, etc) just so I knew that the path I wanted to embark on wasn’t restricted to another 4-year program. For these reasons (and many more), I try to take any opportunity I can to participate in events that are free to all those who want to meet members of the tech community, get help on whatever they’re coding, or even just field any questions for someone who’s brand new to the scene and want to discover if this is something they might be passionate about.

NodeSchool is definitely one of my favorite organizations to participate in. Granted, I’ve only been twice (once as a student, another as a mentor), but both have been amazing experiences with truly awesome people who want to help this eager group of learners, however possible. The curriculum is free and available on their [site](http://nodeschool.io/), and offers digestible lessons that range from the very basics of JavaScript, to very engaging and specific “electives”, including frameworks and libraries like React, Koa, and WebGL. The courses are for the most part ran in your Terminal, and are a great way to quickly dive into a new technology and get a feel for things.

If you haven’t checked out NodeSchool yet, I would highly encourage you to do so! Whether you’re looking to attend as a student or a mentor, it is a great time, and know that you’re contributing to a community who will want to pay it forward and keep the learning going!
