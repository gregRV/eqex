It's been about a week since my last post. Without going into all the detail that noone will ever read anyway, I just lost someone very close to me, and needless to say it's made it incredibly difficult to focus on anything. This has been the only time my short attention span has ever proven useful to me. I've been able to distract myself with various things (binge watching tv, running, blasting music through my headphones for hours at a time), just to keep myself from thinking about *it*. Now that it's been a few days, I'm hoping that focusing of my energy productively and diving back into code will help me through this really weird, depressing, gray period of life.

That being said, I've been thinking about my approach to studying/reviewing. So far, I've been looking through old challenges that utilize Sinatra as the framework. I actually really like using Sinatra, because you have a greater sense of control over the application (Sinatra is very bare-bones). However, in all the challenges we work on with Sinatra, we end up using a template provided by the instructors, known as the "Sinatra Skeleton". It's very useful and well-commented, but I know that I'm ultimately never going to use this template professionally, so it may be time to return to Rails.

I'm very excited for this step because when I was a student, we never really touched Rails 4, so there's lots of new awesomeness to discover. As of now, the short-term plan of attack is as follows:

- review old Rails projects/repos
- go through Code School Rails courses
- resume current/upcoming projects in Rails instead of Sinatra
- continue to incorporate responsive design learned a few weeks ago

It's been a good while since my last dive into Rails, so hopefully I can get some good work done this weekend.
