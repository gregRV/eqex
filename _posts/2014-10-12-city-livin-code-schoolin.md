So the past few days have been exhausting, but fun overall. I decided to head to the city for a concert, and with that, made all my normal rounds. I was able to visit all my awesome coworkers at the DBC office, and we caught up over happy hour. One of the biggest bummers of working remote is that I don't get to hang out with these guys more often, but hopefully the opportunity will open up more next year.

After that, I went to the Kygo concert, which honestly was just ok overall. Granted I had a few whiskys and old fashions, but the set itself just seemed a bit meh. In any case, the crowd was super fun, and I met more fun people, as I tend to do at these events lol. For those unfamiliar with Kygo, here's one of my fav mixes of his:

While I was local, I had to grab some "Chicken in Waffle" from Tempest! Man, I miss city food haha.

Aside from that, I've been trying to keep productive by deciding what project to build out next. Before that, I wanted to continue some Code School courses, especially since I'm almost done with the [Ruby Path][ruby path]. This morning I completed the "Rails Testing for Zombies" course, which was mostly about Test Unit. Though I don't anticipate using Test Unit, it's good to at least play around with for a bit, and the course also included some best practices. Next, I'll be resuming my RSpec learning with the "Testing with RSpec" course. I really feel like I've already done this course before, but hey, any practice is good as I'm trying to strengthen my testing chops.

This week will be another hectic one. I'm heading back into the city this Friday for another event, and will be flying to out of SFO the next morning. Should be fun though! I miss the city, so really trying to take advantage of all opportunities to head out there. I'm even considering getting a cheap motorcycle so I can continue going to events (hackathons, meetups, etc), rather than relying on a weekday-only train to get to/from.

Anywhoosies, that's all for tonight. I'd love to say I'm about to get started on the RSpec course, but Walking Dead just started again sooooo.... yeah.
