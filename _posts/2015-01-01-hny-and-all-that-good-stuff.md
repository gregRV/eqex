*note to self- cmnd+k+p*

Hello, and welcome to 2015! It's been a long time since I've been around these parts, and a good amount of awesome has happened. In short, I spent a few weeks [traveling through a few countries][travel], was inspired by awesome developers and friends at Ruby Conf in my hometown of San Diego, and spent the holiday with friends and family who I hardly get to spend time with these days. These experiences have all been incredible, and I'm so thankful to be in a position with a job where I can exercise the flexibility to do these kinds of things. They're all refreshing in their own ways, and leaves me ready and excited to get back to work.

Time has really flown by the past few months, and I'm even more excited for what's ahead. In just a few days, I'll be moving back into the city (SF) for at least 3 months. Though there are a lot of advantages of working remotely like I've been doing the past 6 months, I'm really missing being able to immerse myself in the developer community. It's a bit hard to stay motivated to continue learning after working day after day at my desk with limited ineraction with others (I'm living waaay away from the city currently), so I'm looking forward to making the most of the next few months. There is so much that I want to learn, do, and eat (LAWD i miss me some SF food)!

This won't be any vacation, though. I'm going to jam pack my work schedule so that I'll have some 'free' time to get back to coding deep-dives. I've already bought a ticket to [forward.js][forward] and plan to spend a lot more time with javascript in the coming months. Right now, I'll be going back over my old notes and projects, as well as new tutorials that I've bookmarked over time. I'm very intrigued by React.js, frameworks like Ionic and Meteor, and pushing mobile apps via Cordova. So much to learn, I can't wait!

PS, here are a few pics from Ruby Conf!
